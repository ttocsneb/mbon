/// mbon is a binary file encoding that is inspired by the NBT
/// format.
///
/// It is formed of a sequence of strongly typed values. Each made up of two
/// parts: a mark which defines the type and size of the data, followed by the
/// data. Marks can be different in size and so a single byte is used to
/// differenciate between types.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ### Dumping
///
/// You can dump binary data using the Dumper struct. You can write values
/// directly or use serde's serialize to write more complex data.
///
/// ```
/// use mbon::dumper::Dumper;
///
/// let a = 32;
/// let b = "Hello World";
/// let c = b'a';
///
/// let mut dumper = Dumper::new();
/// dumper.write_int(a).unwrap();
/// dumper.write(&b).unwrap();
/// dumper.write(&c).unwrap();
///
/// let output = dumper.into_buffer();
/// assert_eq!(output, b"i\x00\x00\x00\x20s\x00\x0bHello Worldca");
/// ```
///
/// ### Parsing
///
/// You can parse binary data using the Parser struct. You can parse Value's
/// directly, but it is recommended to use serde to parse data.
///
/// ```
/// use mbon::parser::Parser;
/// use mbon::data::Value;
///
/// let data = b"i\x00\x00\x00\x20s\x00\x0bHello Worldca";
///
/// let mut parser = Parser::new(data);
///
/// let a = parser.next_value().unwrap();
/// let b: String = parser.next().unwrap();
/// let c: u8 = parser.next().unwrap();
///
/// if let Value::Int(a) = a {
///     assert_eq!(a, 32);
/// } else {
///     panic!("a should have been an int");
/// }
///
/// assert_eq!(b, "Hello World");
/// assert_eq!(c, b'a');
/// ```
///
/// ### Embedded Objects
///
/// If you are wanting to embed a predefined object inside the format, you can
/// impl ObjectDump/ObjectParse. Keep in mind that you will need to call
/// write_obj/parse_obj to take advantage of it.
///
/// ```
/// use mbon::parser::Parser;
/// use mbon::dumper::Dumper;
/// use mbon::error::Error;
/// use mbon::object::{ObjectDump, ObjectParse};
///
/// #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
/// struct Foo {
///     a: i32,
///     b: String,
///     c: char,
/// }
///
/// impl ObjectDump for Foo {
///     type Error = Error;
///
///     fn dump_object(&self) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Self::Error> {
///         let mut dumper = Dumper::new();
///
///         dumper.write(&self.a)?;
///         dumper.write(&self.b)?;
///         dumper.write(&self.c)?;
///
///         Ok(dumper.into())
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl ObjectParse for Foo {
///     type Error = Error;
///
///     fn parse_object(object: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
///         let mut parser = Parser::new(object);
///
///         let a = parser.next()?;
///         let b = parser.next()?;
///         let c = parser.next()?;
///
///         Ok(Self { a, b, c })
///     }
/// }
///
/// let foo = Foo { a: 32, b: "Hello World".to_owned(), c: 'ðŸ« ' };
/// let mut dumper = Dumper::new();
///
/// dumper.write_obj(&foo).unwrap();
///
/// let mut parser = Parser::new(dumper.buffer());
///
/// let new_foo: Foo = parser.next_obj().unwrap();
///
/// assert_eq!(foo, new_foo);
/// ```

/// ## Specification
///
/// | Name   | Description                       |
/// |--------|-----------------------------------|
/// | Long   | 64 bit integer                    |
/// | Int    | 32 bit integer                    |
/// | Short  | 16 bit integer                    |
/// | Char   | 8 bit integer                     |
/// | Float  | 32 bit IEEE-754 float             |
/// | Double | 64 bit IEEE-754 float             |
/// | Null   | Only the mark                     |
/// | Bytes  | Unencoded string of bytes         |
/// | Str    | UTF-8 encoded string              |
/// | Object | Embeded preformatted data         |
/// | Enum   | u32 Variant, embed data           |
/// | Array  | `len` list of `item` data         |
/// | List   | list of values                    |
/// | Dict   | `len` list of `key`-`value` pairs |
/// | Map    | list of key-value pairs           |
///
/// ### Numbers
///
/// Every number is defined only by their mark. There is no additional data
/// stored in an number's mark.
///
/// All numbers are stored in a big endian binary form. Integers are internally
/// considered signed, however, there is no requirement that they need to be
/// signed, so it is possible to read an unsigned integer as a signed integer.
///
/// ### Strings
///
/// Strings will store their type marker followed by a u16 for their length e.g.
/// `b"s\x00\x05"` would indicate a string that is 5 bytes long.
///
/// Because of the size indicator, all strings can be no more than 65535 bytes
/// long.
///
/// ### Object
///
/// If you wanted to embed binary data, you can use an object value. This is
/// similar to the bytes value, but it uses an unsigned int for the length. It
/// is meant for storing binary data with a predetermined format.
///
/// ### Enum
///
/// An enum is meant to be compatible with Rust's enum serialization. It is
/// defined by a variant id followed by an embedded Value. To make the enum
/// self-describing, the mark for the embedded value is placed within the enum's
/// mark.
///
/// ### Null
///
/// Null is only uses its mark, there is no data associated with it.
///
/// ### Array
///
/// Sequences can be stored in two forms; The Array being more strict than a
/// list. If a sequence cannot be stored as an array, it will be stored as a
/// list.
///
/// An array is a sequence of items that all share the same mark. This means
/// that all elements must be the same size: A vector of u32's will always be
/// stored as an array, while a vector of strings can only be stored as an array
/// if each string is the same length.
///
/// The Array Mark contains the mark of the contained item followed by then the
/// number of items in a u16.
///
/// ### List
///
/// The list is the more lenient way to store sequences. It simply holds a
/// sequence of all the items. The mark simply holds the number of bytes in the
/// list as a u32.
///
/// ### Dict
///
/// A dict is similar to an array, but it stores key-value pairs instead. All
/// keys must share the same mark and all values must share the same mark.
///
/// The Dict mark contains the key mark, followed by the value mark, and finally
/// the number of items in the dict.
///
/// ### Map
///
/// The map, similar to the list stores any value types, but in a key-value
/// format. This is the fallback format if a value cannot be stored as a dict.
